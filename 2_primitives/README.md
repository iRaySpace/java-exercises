# 2. Primitives

Rationale:
- To be able to understand the importance of data types

Lessons:
- In order to convert number to any other number types, you can use type cast operator
```java
int five = 5;
float twoPointFive = (float) five / 2.0;
```

Objectives:
- Set all of the variables based on the comments
- Replace all static inputs `System.out.println` with variables

Acceptance Criteria:
- Results are `System.out.println`ed from variables with the following outputs:
```
10
10.0
10.0
15
```
